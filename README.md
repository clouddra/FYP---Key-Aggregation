FYP---Key-Aggregation
=====================

Dissertation for NUS SOC titled: **Efficient Key Aggregation for Cloud Storage**

In this project, we explore novel cryptographic techniques for storing multidimensional data in untrusted environments.

Based on the paper [KAC: Key-Aggregate Cryptosystem for Scalable Encrypted Data Sharing](http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/publication/kac-key-aggregate-cryptosystem-scalable-encrypted-data-sharing-cloud).

Read the **report.pdf** in /paper for more details.

Built using [Charm crypto framework] (http://www.charm-crypto.com/Main.html).
